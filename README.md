# Javascript_codes

This is my javascript repository. 

I left golang for a while to study full stack development and datascience  in javascript.

I will be going back to golang after i learned some new things.

I found out that there were tons of stacks and resources in javascript that i can use to improve my building skills for datascience and microservices.

More like having fun while editing an html would be good choice.

I really cant visualize how i can connect these things to one.

Golang has potential but i need more experience to handle those things because the backend, APIs and some of its parts lacks some techniques to make microservices and html rendering.

I went along with my curiosity so that i might learn about javascript.

I will be experimenting and documenting more on this style of learning.

I kinda need some things to make dashboards. 

dashboards are highly needed for data science.

Turns out that javascript was a good choice because it reminded me of Xojo.

Parts where i just use dots and make it easy to read the attributes like this.

document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()

Yeah. i kind of miss using xojo.

The fundamentals are frontend and random by the way.
